# GitExtensions.SVN
This project is for developing a SVN plugin for Git Extensions.


## So is there already a plugin ready to be used?
No. This is work in progress at an very early stage.


## But I need something that works right now!
The [wiki](https://github.com/mast-eu/GitExtensions.SVN/wiki/Workarounds) documents possible solutions.


## I don't like the workarounds from the wiki!
Good, we have something in common. Have a look arround at this project and feel free to contribute.
